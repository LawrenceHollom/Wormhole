# Wormhole
 Godot project for simulating and moving through a wormhole

All computations are done via a home-brew Vector4 class, and a shader.
The setup is two cubic rooms separated by a spherical wormhole; much like the classic image of a wormhole connecting two two-dimensional patches of space, but in one extra dimension.
